    LITERARTURE SURVEY: 
    [1] N. Ratnasri and T. Sharmilan, Vending Machine Technologies: A 
    Review Article. International Journal of Sciences: Basic and Applied 
    Research (IJSBAR). 58. , 2021. 
    Vending Machines are automated machines that dispense selling products 
    such as snacks, beverages, lottery tickets, and etc. It is vital to save time and 
    reduce human energy.  These vending machines are developed in the way of 
    Non IoT-based and IoT based methods. These Non IoT based machines are not 
    smart and are not operated in real-time data, which are functioned when giving 
    cash or card and inputs (vending things) of the machine. It is controlled by a 
    microcontroller and distributed the given inputs. IoT-based machines are 
    computerized, which have cashless payment facilities, order facility before 
    going to the vending machine to order things, and can be identified the location 
    of machines by the customer. These IoT- based machines are assisted by 
    suppliers to identify the availability of the stocks. Simulation software and 
    prototype are used to validate the machines. In this review, it is found that most 
    of the vending machines developed are capable of operating without IoT 
    technology, and nowadays, vending machine systems are required to 
    implement using IoT with machine learning, and artificial technologies to 
    satisfy customer preferences.

    <p>Verilog was started initially as a proprietary hardware modeling language by 
        Gateway Design Automation Inc. around 1984. It is rumored that the original 
        language was designed by taking features from the most popular HDL language of 
        the time, called HiLo, as well as from traditional computer languages such as 
        C. At that time, Verilog was not standardized and the language modified itself in 
        almost all the revisions that came out within 1984 to 1990. 
        Verilog simulator was first used beginning in 1985 and was extended 
        substantially through 1987. The implementation was the Verilog simulator sold by 
        Gateway. The first major extension was Verilog-XL, which added a few features 
        and implemented the infamous "XL algorithm" which was a very efficient method 
        for doing gate-level simulation. 
        The time was late 1990. Cadence Design System, whose primary product at 
        that time included thin film process simulator, decided to acquire Gateway 
        Automation System. Along with other Gateway products, Cadence now became 
        the owner of the Verilog language, and continued to market Verilog as both a 
        language and a simulator. 
        At the same time, Synopsys was marketing the top-down design methodology, 
        using Verilog. This was a powerful combination. In 1990, Cadence recognized that 
        if Verilog remained a closed language, the pressures of standardization would 
        eventually cause the industry to shift to VHDL. Consequently, Cadence organized 
        the Open Verilog International (OVI), and in 1991 gave it the documentation for 
        the Verilog Hardware Description Language. This was the event which "opened" 
        the language.</p>

    <p>HDL is an abbreviation of Hardware Description Language. Any 
        digital system can be represented in a REGISTER TRANSFER LEVEL 
        (RTL) and HDLs are used to describe this RTL.Verilog is one such HDL 
        and it is a general-purpose language â€“easy to learn and use. Its syntax is 
        similar to C.The idea is to specify how the data flows between registers 
        and how the design processes the data. 
        To define RTL, hierarchical design concepts play a very significant 
        role. Hierarchical design methodology facilitates the digital design flow 
        with several levels of abstraction.Verilog HDL can utilize these levels of 
        abstraction to produce a simplified and efficient representation of the 
        RTL description of any digital design. 
        For example, an HDL might describe the layout of the wires, 
        resistors and transistors on an Integrated Circuit (IC) chip, i.e., the 
        switch level or, it may describe the design at a more micro level in terms 
        of logical gates and flip flops in a digital system, i.e., the gate level. 
        Verilog supports all of these levels.</p>

    <p>Any hardware description language like Verilog can be design in 
        two ways one is bottom- up design and other one is top-down 
        design. 
        Bottom-Up Design: 
        Traditional method of electronic design is bottom-up (designing 
        from transistors and moving to a higher level of gates and, finally, the 
        system). But with the increase in design complexity traditional 
        bottom-up designs have to give way to new structural, hierarchical 
        design methods. 
        Top-Down Design: 
        For HDL representation it is convenient and efficient to adapt this 
        design-style. A real top-down design allows early testing, fabrication 
        technology independence, a structured system design and offers many 
        other advantages. But it is very difficult to follow a pure top-down 
        design. Due to this fact most designs are mix of both the methods, 
        implementing  some  key  elements  of  both  design  styles</p>

    <p>System Specification: 
        The first step of any design process is to lay down the specifications of the system. 
        System specificationis a high level representation of the system. The factors to be 
        considered in this process include: performance, functionality, and physical dimensions like 
        size of the chip. The specification of a system is a compromise between market requirements, 
        technology and economical viability. The end results are specifications for the size, speed, 
        power, and functionality of the VLSI system. 
        Architectural Design: 
        The basic architecture of the system is designed in this step. This includes, such 
        decisions as RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) versus CISC (Complex 
        Instruction Set Computer), number of ALUs, Floating Point units, number and structure of 
        pipelines, and size of caches among others. The outcome of architectural design is a Micro
        Architectural Specification (MAS). 
        Behavioral or Functional Design: 
        In this step, main functional units of the system are identified. This also identifies the 
        interconnect requirements between the units. The area, power, and other parameters of each 
        unit are estimated Modules. The key idea is to specify behavior, in terms of input, output and 
        timing of each unit, without specifying its internal structure .The outcome of functional design 
        is usually a timing diagram or other relationships between units.</p>

    <p>The purpose of circuit design is to develop a circuit representation based 
        on the logic design. The Boolean expressions are converted into a circuit 
        representation by taking into consideration the speed and power requirements of 
        the original design. Circuit Simulation is used to verify the correctness and 
        timing of each component. 
        The circuit design is usually expressed in a detailed circuit diagram. This 
        diagram shows the circuit elements (cells, macros, gates, transistors) and 
        interconnection between these elements representation.</p>
